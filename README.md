## Running the bot

To run the bot, you can use the command `python gettingstarted.py` (or `py`) in the terminal. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure you activate it first.

## Adding the bot to a server

To add the bot to a server, you need to create an invite link. You can do this by going to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and selecting your application. Then, go to the OAuth2 tab and select the bot scope. You can then select the permissions you want the bot to have. Once you have done this, you can copy the link and paste it into your browser. You will then be able to add the bot to a server.
